# Lock Feature Security Improvements

## Overview
The lock feature has been completely redesigned to address critical security concerns and provide enterprise-grade protection for user data.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Lock feature was NOT synced with Supabase backend**
**Previous State**: All lock settings and passwords were stored in localStorage only
**Security Risk**: Passwords stored in plain text, no cross-device sync, easily accessible

**✅ Fixed**:
- Created `user_lock_settings` table in Supabase database
- Passwords are now hashed using SHA-256 before storage
- All lock settings sync across devices and tabs
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own settings

### 2. ❌ **Lock state persisted across tabs/devices**
**Previous State**: Once unlocked, remained unlocked across all tabs and devices
**Security Risk**: Anyone with access to the device could see protected content

**✅ Fixed**:
- **Session-based unlock state**: Unlock state is now session-only and doesn't persist
- **Auto-lock on tab switch**: Automatically locks when user switches tabs or minimizes browser
- **Auto-lock on page focus**: Locks when returning from another tab
- **Auto-lock on page unload**: Locks when leaving the page
- **Always start locked**: Application always starts in locked state if password is set

### 3. ❌ **Password fields retained previous input**
**Previous State**: Password fields kept previously entered passwords visible
**Security Risk**: Anyone could see the password in the input field

**✅ Fixed**:
- **Automatic field clearing**: Password fields are cleared after each use
- **Clear on failed attempts**: Password field clears immediately on failed unlock attempts
- **Clear on modal close**: All fields cleared when modal is closed
- **Clear on mode change**: Fields cleared when switching between lock modes
- **Proper autocomplete attributes**: Added appropriate autocomplete attributes for better security

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_lock_settings (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  has_password BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  password_hash TEXT, -- SHA-256 hashed password
  lock_journal BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id)
);
```

### Security Features
1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before storage
2. **Row Level Security**: Database policies ensure users can only access their own settings
3. **Session Management**: Unlock state is session-only and automatically expires
4. **Cross-Device Sync**: Lock settings sync across all user devices
5. **Automatic Locking**: Multiple triggers for automatic locking

### Auto-Lock Triggers
- **Tab Switch**: When user switches to another tab
- **Page Minimize**: When browser window is minimized
- **Page Focus**: When returning from another tab
- **Page Unload**: When leaving the page
- **User Change**: When different user logs in

## Migration Required

To implement these changes, you need to:

1. **Run the database migration**:
   ```bash
   # Apply the migration to your Supabase database
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Install the new dependency**:
   ```bash
   npm install js-sha256 --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Passwords stored in plain text
- ❌ Unlock state persisted indefinitely
- ❌ No cross-device sync
- ❌ Password fields retained input
- ❌ No automatic locking

### After
- ✅ Passwords securely hashed
- ✅ Session-based unlock state
- ✅ Cross-device synchronization
- ✅ Automatic field clearing
- ✅ Multiple auto-lock triggers
- ✅ Always starts locked if password set

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Protection**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
2. **Session Security**: Unlock state expires automatically
3. **Cross-Device Security**: Lock settings sync across all devices
4. **Automatic Protection**: Multiple triggers ensure content is always protected
5. **Database Security**: Row Level Security prevents unauthorized access

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test cross-device sync**: Set lock on one device, verify it appears on another
2. **Test auto-lock triggers**: Switch tabs, minimize browser, verify auto-lock
3. **Test password security**: Verify password fields clear after use
4. **Test session expiration**: Verify unlock state doesn't persist after page reload
5. **Test database security**: Verify users can only access their own lock settings
